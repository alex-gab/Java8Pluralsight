Summarizing this section, we should note that
programming a grep equivalent has shown some
strengths of the Stream API: the solutions for
the Warlier examples are straightforward,
and respecifying the problem to simulate
the different options required only small
corresponding changes in the code.
In the last example, we saw how cooperation
with Java WIO enables the Stream API
to process input from large files with,
as we shall see in c6.7, a very high degree
of parallel speedup.
